# Theme Park Django Reference Architecture

A canonical, security-first Django reference architecture for a Theme Park information system, designed for Years 10–12 students in the **Software Engineering 11–12** course (NSW Curriculum) and as a model for the **Year 12 Major Project**.

This project demonstrates:

- a realistic **relational database** for a Theme Park (customers, bookings, and related entities),
- a **Django web application** with industrial-strength security practices,
- modern Python packaging using **`pyproject.toml`** and **`uv`**,
- a structure that can withstand **SAST** and **DAST** scanning at a high standard,
- a clear link to **NESA Software Engineering 11–12 syllabus outcomes**, especially the **Software Engineering Project / Major Project** focus area.

## 1. How this reference architecture supports the Major Project

The **Software Engineering Project** (Major Project) requires students to:

- **define and analyse requirements** of a problem (SE‑ID‑01),
- **define data structures and data types**, including data dictionaries (SE‑ID‑01.04),
- **design, implement, test, document, and maintain** a software solution over time,
- apply **project management**, **collaboration**, and **version control** practices. 

This repository is designed as a **worked example** that students can:

- **study** to understand how a professional‑style project is structured,
- **adapt** as a conceptual model when planning their own Major Project,
- **compare** against their own work to check:
  - Have I defined my entities and relationships clearly?
  - Is my architecture modular and maintainable?
  - Have I considered security, testing, and deployment?

Teachers can use this repo as:

- a **reference implementation** when giving feedback on student designs,
- a **benchmark** for documentation, security considerations, and version control usage.

## 2. NESA syllabus links and outcomes

This reference architecture is intentionally aligned with key outcomes from the **Software Engineering 11–12 Syllabus (2022)** and the **Software Engineering Project** resources. 

It particularly supports:

- **Requirements and design**
  - Defining the problem and user needs.
  - Creating **data dictionaries**, **ERDs**, and **database schemas**.
- **Implementation**
  - Using **Django** as a modern web framework.
  - Applying **modular design** (apps, models, views, templates).
  - Using **`pyproject.toml`** and **`uv`** for reproducible environments.
- **Testing and quality**
  - Structuring the project to support **automated tests**.
  - Designing for **SAST/DAST‑friendly** analysis (clear boundaries, minimal “magic”).
- **Security and ethics**
  - Applying **security‑first** patterns (input validation, ORM use, CSRF protection, authentication/authorisation).
  - Considering **social and ethical** implications of software systems.
- **Project management and documentation**
  - Using **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
  - Providing **clear documentation** (README, data dictionary, ERD, architecture notes).

Students can map their own Major Project documentation (problem definition, design, implementation, testing, evaluation) against this reference.

## 3. Why Django (and not Flask) for this reference

Both Flask and Django are valuable, but this reference architecture uses **Django** because:

- **Batteries included:** Django provides an ORM, admin interface, authentication, forms, and security middleware out of the box.
- **Relational focus:** The Major Project often involves **non‑trivial data models**. Django’s ORM and migrations make this explicit and teachable.
- **Security defaults:** Django ships with strong defaults:
  - CSRF protection,
  - XSS and SQL injection protections via the template engine and ORM,
  - secure password hashing and authentication framework.
- **Scalability of ideas:** Students can start with a small app and grow to multiple apps, each with its own models and views, mirroring real‑world architectures.

Flask remains excellent for lightweight PWAs and micro‑services; Django is chosen here to model a **full, multi‑entity, security‑aware system** suitable as a Major Project reference.

## 4. Project structure (Django + `pyproject.toml` + `uv`)

This repository uses **`pyproject.toml`** and **`uv`** for modern, fast, and reproducible Python dependency management.
